# Time:  O(M * (S + (S/W)^2)), W is tuned by testing, and smaller or larger W is not necessarily good
#                            , for samller example, W = 13, it uses 50% of S on average
#                            , for larger example, W = 316, then S = (S/W)^2), O(M * (S + (S/W)^2)) = O(M * S)
#                            , but it uses 60% of S on average and worse than that of W = 25 (11% of S)
# Space: O(S)
